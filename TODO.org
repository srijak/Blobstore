* DONE Implement keyspace
** Have basics of zookeeper integration (need to reconnect/manage connections  etcs but thats later)
** Add/remove vnodes from keyspace. Get vnode for a given hash.
*** For now vnodes start at a certain offset and are responsible for keys that hash to them
*** Might make sense to rethink this to go towards partitioning the keyspace into n, and have vnodes elect to own certain partitions. More flexible.
* DONE Flesh out blobserver to write to local vno
* Make it an rpc server that can be called to write to remote vnode
* Replication
** concept of secondary vnodes.
** tunable synchronous (return only after writes to x replications have completed)
